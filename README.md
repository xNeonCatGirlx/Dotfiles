# Dotfiles
My dotfile for Hyprland, tested on Asahi Linux

Including cava, fastfetch, fcitx, fcitx5, wofi, waylogout, nvim, Hyprland and Waybar

# Dependencies

You will need:
lrcsnc from https://github.com/xNeonCatGirlx/lrcsnc-without-romanization

cava from https://github.com/karlstav/cava

pavucontrol from https://github.com/pulseaudio/pavucontrol

For the power consumption in the bottom bar, you will need to find where the system reads your power and change it in the waybar config file

Lo-fi theme
