# Dotfiles
My dotfile for Hyprland, tested on Asahi Linux

Including cava, fastfetch, fcitx, fcitx5, wofi, waylogout, nvim, Hyprland and Waybar

To change the color fo the theme, you will need to install pywals, and to match the theme in firefox, you will need https://github.com/Frewacom/pywalfox

# Dependencies

You will need:
lrcsnc from https://github.com/xNeonCatGirlx/lrcsnc-without-romanization

cava from https://github.com/karlstav/cava

pavucontrol from https://github.com/pulseaudio/pavucontrol

pywals from https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal

For the power consumption in the bottom bar, you will need to find where the system reads your power and change it in the waybar config file
